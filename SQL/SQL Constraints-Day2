SQL Constraints (Restrictions) :
            In order to restrict certain records to table we have constraints.

1.Primary Key 
      Rules: No Duplicate,No NULLS 
      Def'n: It's a unique identifier in a table which have no dublicates and null values
                  EX:Adherenumber


2.Foreign Key  
    Rules:   Have Nulls ,Have Dublicates
    Def'n:   Its a key in which we are refering to primary key column from another table.
             Its always better to take one tables primary key as a reference in another 
             table ,So this becomes foreignkey.Establishes a relationship between two tables.


3.Unique Key  
          Rule:  Should not have dublicates, but null are acceptable ,Its a optional 
          Def'n: Its exactly same as primary key it will not have dublicates but you can have null values 
                EX:PhoneNumber its optional if you gave but should be unique


4.Check 
        Def'n:  Applying some conditions to the columns is called check constraint
				        Ex. Age>18 FOR AMAZONE ACC
				
5. DEFAULT 
        Def'n:  Set a defult value if no value is specified/ user has not put anything we have default

6.Not NULL
