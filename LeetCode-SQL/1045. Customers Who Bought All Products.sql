# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT C.customer_id  FROM Customer AS C 
JOIN Product AS P ON P.product_key=C.product_key
group by C.customer_id 
having count(distinct C.product_key)=(select count(DISTINCT product_key) from Product)

SELECT CUSTOMER_ID AS customer_id
FROM CUSTOMER
GROUP BY CUSTOMER_ID
HAVING (COUNT(DISTINCT(PRODUCT_KEY))=(SELECT COUNT(PRODUCT_KEY) FROM PRODUCT))
